- **Price** - that is where you need to decide the price that you need to  buy your bitcoin at e.g. 15000 000  TZS . The price that you enter here  is the price for 1 bitcoin. It does not matter if you have only a fraction of the btc.
-  **Volume** - This section is auto filled by the system, you do not need to enter anything here.
- **Amount** - You enter in how much you want to use to buy bitcoin. The amount has to be already in your TZS wallet.
-**Buy  BTC** - Click  on the button to Buy your bitcoin.
- After Buying an order it will  be displayed  on the **Order Book**  and in your account it will be displayed on the **My Pending Orders** and it will attract sellers.
- Orders are displayed on the **Order Book**  and  labeled in green under **Bid** starting with the Best Price at that moment. Highest bidder will be the customer with the highest price from the rest.
- If you want to buy BTC instantly you match  the  best price on the market.
- When a  seller matches your order your BTC wallet on Golix  is automatically  credited with bitcoin.

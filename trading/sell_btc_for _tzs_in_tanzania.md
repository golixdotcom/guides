- **Amount** - The  section is auto- filled  by the system so that you see how much you will get  after selling your bitcoin.
-**Sell BTC** - Click  on the button to sell your bitcoin.
- After selling an order it will  be displayed  on the **Order Book**  and in your account it will be displayed on the **My Pending Orders** and it will attract buyers.
- Orders are displayed on the  order book starting with the **Best Price** at that moment (cheapest).

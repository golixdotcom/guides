- After selling an order it will  be displayed  on the **Order Book**  and in your account it will be displayed on the **My Pending Orders** and it will attract buyers.
- Orders are displayed on the book starting with the Best Price at that moment (cheapest).
- If you want your BTC to be bought instantly you decide a best price on the market.

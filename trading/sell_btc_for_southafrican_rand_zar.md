- **Price** - that is where you need to decide the price that you need to sell your btc at e.g 98 500 ZAR . The price that you enter here  is the price for 1 btc. It does not matter if you have only a fraction of the btc.
-  **Volume** - That  is where you enter in how much BTC you want to sell. This can be a fraction to any amount of BTC that is available in your Golix wallet.
- **Amount** - The  section is auto- filled  by the system so that you see how much you will get  after selling your BTC.
- **Sell BTC** - Click  on the button to sell your btc.
- After selling an order it will  be displayed  on the **Order Book**  and in your account it will be displayed on the **My Pending Orders** and it will attract buyers.
- Orders are displayed on the book starting with the Best Price at that moment (cheapest).
- If you want your BTC to be bought instantly you decide a best price on the market.
- When a buyer matches your order your South African Rand is automatically  credited into your ZAR wallet.

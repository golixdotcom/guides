# What is Golix

Golix is Africaâ€™s leading cryptocurrency exchange. Golix was born out of the frustration from an inability to make online and/or cross-border payments. The cryptocurrency exchange therefore exists to give every person in Africa, Financial Autonomy.
Today, Africa is the hardest place in the world to make online payments and/or cross-border payments because of the limitations of local fiat currencies and the disabilities of incumbent financial institutions. Golix plans to give every person in Africa Financial Autonomy by making it super easy for any African to  use their local fiat currency to buy and/or sell whatever cryptocurrency they want.

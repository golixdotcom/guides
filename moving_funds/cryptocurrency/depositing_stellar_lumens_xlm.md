Never make a deposit of stellar without coping the memo.

- When you send XLM  wallet from another wallet to Golix you are **Depositing XLM wallet  into your Golix Wallet**
-  The  cryptocurrency deposit  will appear in your wallet after receiving  confirmations from the network.

- **Tip** - the green tab written  **New Address** is only used when you want to generate a new address. If you generate a new address your old address will still be linked to your account.

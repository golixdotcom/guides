A framework of naming files  and describing what they contain and how they relate to other files. File Naming Conventions is done through identifying the key elements of the Tutorials  and the important differences and commonalities.

The **goal** of this Section is to guide anyone on how to contribute to Tutorials.

Rules to create a Tutorial 
 
1. Start your filename with the most important parameter component.

2. Use relevant components in your filename to provide description and context
The filename should contain the essential elements of each file, dependent upon what is suitable for your retrieval needs. File names should outlast the records creator who originally named the file, so think about what information would be helpful to someone in 15 years.

3. Keep the filename a reasonable length
Long file names do not work well with some types of software so it’s best to keep them short. To achieve this, you could consider:
Shortening the year to 2 numbers
Abbreviate file name components
Use as few words as possible to convey the identity of the document

4. Avoid special characters and spacesSpecial characters such as  ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ' ; < > ? , [ ] { } ‘ ” and | should   be avoided.
  Do not use spaces. Some software will not recognize file names with spaces. Use these alternatives instead:
  Underscores (e.g. file_name.xxx)
  Camelcase, where the first letter of each section of text is capitalized (e.g. FileName.xxx)
4. When including a number in a file name always give it as a two-digit number rather than one, i.e. 01, 02 … 99, unless it is a year or another number with more than two digits
6. Order the elements in a file name in the most appropriate way to retrieve the record.
7. The file names of records relating to recurring events should include the date and a description of the event, except where the inclusion of any of either of these elements would be incompatible with rule 2.
8. The version number of a record should be indicated in its file name by the inclusion of ‘d’ followed by the version number and, where applicable, ‘d’ indicating ‘draft version’.


# Examples On How To Name Tutorials

## Example 1:
- You want to contribute  a tutorial with the title **“What is cryptocurrency”**. This is how you do it:
- The name of the file should be **Cryptocurrency.ascii**
- The file should be in the folder called **Tutorials** 
- The full path of the tutorial should therefore  be **Tutorials/CryptoCurrency.asciidoc**.

The other Tutorials will be named as follows:-

 - History of Money will be **Tutorials/HistoryOfMoney.asciidoc**.
 - How to place a limit order on Golix will be **Tutorials/PlacingLimitOrder.asciidoc**.
 - How to cancel a pending order on Golix will be  **Tutoria/CancelPendingOrder.asciidoc**.
 - What is an orderbook will be **Tutorials/Orderbook.asciidoc**

# Naming Conventions Of the Guides Section

## Introduction

A framework of naming files  and describing what they contain and how they relate to other files. File Naming Conventions is done through identifying the key elements of the Tutorials  and the important differences and commonalities.

The **goal** of this Section is to guide anyone on how to contribute to Tutorials.

Rules to create a Tutorial 
 
1. Keep file and folder names short, but meaningful.
2. Avoid unnecessary repetition and redundant words in file names and file paths.
3. Use capital letters to delimit words, not spaces.
4. When including a number in a file name always give it as a two-digit number rather than one, i.e. 01, 02 … 99, unless it is a year or another number with more than two digits
5. Avoid using common words such as ‘draft’ or ‘letter’ at the start of file names, unless doing so will make it easier to retrieve the record.
6. Order the elements in a file name in the most appropriate way to retrieve the record.
7. The file names of records relating to recurring events should include the date and a description of the event, except where the inclusion of any of either of these elements would be incompatible with rule 2.
8. The version number of a record should be indicated in its file name by the inclusion of ‘d’ followed by the version number and, where applicable, ‘d’ indicating ‘draft version’.
9. Avoid using non-alphanumeric characters in file names.

# Examples On How To Name Tutorials

- WhatIsCryptocurrency
- HistoryOfMoney
- HowToPlaceALimitOrderOnGolix
- HowToCancelPendingOrderOnGolix
- WhatIsAnOrderBook

## Example 1:
- You want to contribute  a tutorial with the title **“What is cryptocurrency”**. This is how you do it:
- The name of the file should be Cryptocurrency.ascii
- The file should be in the folder called **Tutorials** and that folder should be in the path called **TradeDetails**.
- The full path of the tutorial should therefore  be **Tutorials/Tradedetails/CryptoCurrency.asciidoc**.

## Example 2
The idea is to give an actual example of how to use the convention that you recommended for someone who is contributing a tutorial
